My morning workout was strength training, specifically working on legs. I usually feel a burn when I get to my max reps, and I was expecting it, but I didn't! I was shocked. I increased my reps by at least 3-5 more with Lactigo.And after my shower, I feel like I didn't even push myself this morning! I'm so excited about the benefits of this product!"

Lactigo is AMAZING ❤️❤️ So, Amy and I managed to catch a sickness while we were in Utah. It's awful, nonstop coughing since Wednesday for me. Amy has the same and after 2 days of no sleep and nonstop coughing, she applied Lactigo on her chest and throat, and hasn't had a coughing fit since!I really need this coughing to stop. Coughing fits so bad that I can't catch a breath."

        "text": "I'm 45 years old and have had two babies over the past five years. I've been strength training six days a week for the last 14 or 15 months. This effort has been to free myself from the weight gain over the last 10 years due to babies, work, motherhood, and life in general. Exercising has been a challenge because every time I lift heavy weights or go hard on my bike, I get severe pain in my ankles which has prevented me from being able to move as freely. I was introduced to Lactigo about 7 weeks ago, and it has literally changed my life. I applied it on my right side and then did HIIT training. I felt the difference immediately between both sides, and my right leg didn't feel as tired anymore."

I started using Lactigo on my knee and my right thumb, and I am impressed. I hadn't been able to 'trust' my right thumb to support a cup of coffee for over a year without difficulty, and my hands would shake with anxiety. After 3 days of applying Lactigo once a day, I am now holding coffee cups and shaking hands like nobody's business! So thrilled to have even these simple things back. Thank you, Lactigo!"

        "text": "Another amazing Lactigo testimonial (from me). I swear, this gel will never stop amazing me. So 2 days ago, I put some gel on one side of my body and then did a strength training workout. I was really excited about what was going on in my life and wasn't paying attention to my form and lifting extremely heavy weights. I think I overdid it and pulled a muscle in my right shoulder. I didn't feel it during the exercise, but about an hour after, it became extremely painful. I knew I definitely pulled something. Since I applied the gel 2 nights ago, I have not been able to sleep on that side and it's been better each day. The pain has gotten less and less and right now, I have 90% mobility in my arm. This product is amazing!"
